LeapInstrument (working title)
==============================
An instrument made using the Leap Motion SDK and JSyn, written in Scala.

In the pursuit of making a Leap Motion theramin, I realized that there already were already many existing Leap Motion theramins. After some disappointment, I figured I could do one better and just make my own instrument.

As such, this aims to be more than just a "cool music app", but more of an actual instrument with a unique timbre and that is intuitive and natural to play.
